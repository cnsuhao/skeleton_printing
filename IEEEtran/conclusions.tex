\section{Conclusion, Limitation, and Future Work}
Compared with existing partition-based methods, the advantages of our partition method are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The models are support-free, especially for the 3D printing techniques including SLA, SLM and SLS. For FDM technique, it requires a bed of support that consumes very little volume of materials.
\item The seams on the assembled model are minimized in terms of cut number and cut length.
\end{itemize}
