\section{Results}
[In the examples, show how the training-and-learning procedure saves running time]

We have evaluated our skeletal partition approach on a number of models, including man-made art objects and organic forms. Figures LLL show partition results, and the printed models and their experimental statistics.




[show the printed model without any cutting operation, the partitioned CAD model, the assembled printed model, the statistics on time and material saving, for all 12 models]
